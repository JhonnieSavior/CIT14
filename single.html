			<p>Hanging out with friends is one of the major factor that releases bad thoughts towards oneself. It makes you smile whenever you reminisce about the moments in your life. This also brings inspiration through the hardships that you all surpassed in your lifetime.</p>
			<p>Friendship is an unintimate committed relationship between two people in which they both have a genuine sense of love, care and affection to one another without any hesitation or misunderstandings. Two or more people with the same interests, thoughts and emotions usually have a strong bond.</p>
			<p>Friendship is known to have no restrictions on age, race, rank, class, religion and ethnicity, but sometimes it is seen that economic disparity or other distinction is detrimental to friendship.Therefore it can be said that true and real friendship between two like-minded and uniform status people who feel love to each other is possible.
			There are many friends in the world who at the time of prosperity still stay together but only real, genuine and loyal friends who never let us be alone in our bad times, times of misery and trouble.
			The bad times make us realize that the mates are good and bad. Everyone is naturally attracted to money, but true friends never make us feel bad when we need money or other help. Lending or borrowing money from friends often, though, holds friendship in high risk.</p>
			<p>Friendship can be influenced or held by others at any moment, so in this partnership we have to strike a balance.
			Often, because of the ego and self-respect, friendship is destroyed. True friendship requires proper comprehension, happiness, and faith in nature. True friend never tricks, but continues to inspire one another to do things right in life.
			But sometimes the sense of friendship is totally changed because of some fake and cheating friends who are always using another in the wrong way. Many people tend to join as soon as possible, but they also tend to end their relationship as soon as they satisfy their desires.</p>
			<p>It's hard to say anything negative about friendship, but it's true that friendship cheats any careless person. Now a day, in the crowd of bad and good men, it's very hard to find true friends, but if someone has a true friend, he's fortunate and precious in the world.</p>

						to forget the sad reality and agony in their lives. Hearing the waves upon the sand, touching your feet and
						feeling the touch of the water's cool breeze makes everyone scream out of excitement as they go to the water. 
						Laugh, jump, swim and all that stuff is revolving actions of your body when your at the beach. Summer vibes are doesn't
						only bring happiness but it is also a collection of positive thoughts in everyone's mind. In a way, going to a beach can make us ponder in quite a metaphor. "Conquering all the waves of suffering in life
						and enjoying every moment of life experiences for everytime the sun still shines upon you".

				<p> Light is the basic part of our existence that helps us see what reality looks like. 
					It brings hope, to see what we seek to see, for our future and reality. We are walking in the darkness where life is in a hopeless situation. 
					Light gives us the strength to believe and walk in the middle of darkness. It's the power to lend our eyes see the beautiful creation of God and everything around us.
					 Someday, everyone is going to look at you with shine of light in their eyes you've never seen before. Wait for it to shine.

				<p> A building that creates a home for the Christians to worship God and reunite their souls 
					for the renewal of themselves through sanctity.
						Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox believers would agree with me up to a point. 
						They affirm the authority of Scripture as God’s Word. But they add the parallel
						 authority of tradition, especially as embodied in the creeds and historic teachings 
						 of the church, and in the bishops who guard and pass on this tradition. 
						 I believe that Christian tradition ought to be taken very seriously. 
						 We Christians have much to learn from our brothers and sisters who have gone before 
						 us and who have sought to understand and to be the church. But, ultimately, 
						 I’m convinced we should weigh their convictions and practices in light 
						 of biblical teaching. For me, as for millions of Protestants across the globe, 
						 Scripture trumps church tradition though without denying the value of tradition.

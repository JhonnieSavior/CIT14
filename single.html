			<h1 class="mb0">Friendships</h1>
			<div class="meta"><span><a href="#">Packaging</a>, <a href="#">Illustration</a></span></div>
			<p>Hanging out with friends is one of the major factor that releases bad thoughts toward oneself. It makes you smile whenever you reminisce moments about college life. Also bring inspiration to the hardships that you all surpassed in the old age of your time.</p>
			<p>Friendship is a committed friendship between two people in which they both have a genuine sense of love, care and affection to each other without any requests or misunderstandings. Two people with the same likes, thoughts and emotions usually have friendship.</p>
			<p>Friendship is known to have no restrictions on age, race, rank, class, religion and ethnicity, but sometimes it is seen that economic disparity or other distinction is detrimental to friendship.Therefore it can be said that true and real friendship between two like-minded and uniform status people who feel love to each other is possible.
			There are many friends in the world who at the time of prosperity still stay together but only real, genuine and loyal friends who never let us be alone in our bad times, times of misery and trouble.
			The bad times make us realize that the mates are good and bad. Everyone is naturally attracted to money, but true friends never make us feel bad when we need money or other help. Lending or borrowing money from friends often, though, holds friendship in high risk.</p>
			<p>Friendship can be influenced or held by others at any moment, so in this partnership we have to strike a balance.
			Often, because of the ego and self-respect, friendship is destroyed. True friendship requires proper comprehension, happiness, and faith in nature. True friend never tricks, but continues to inspire one another to do things right in life.
			But sometimes the sense of friendship is totally changed because of some fake and cheating friends who are always using another in the wrong way. Many people tend to join as soon as possible, but they also tend to end their relationship as soon as they satisfy their desires.</p>
			<p>It's hard to say anything negative about friendship, but it's true that friendship cheats any careless person. Now a day, in the crowd of bad and good men, it's very hard to find true friends, but if someone has a true friend, he's fortunate and precious in the world.</p>

					<p> Beach is a vibe for everyone. People here in Baguio go to San Juan, La Union just to chill and unwind

						to forget the sad reality and agony of their lives. Hearing the waves upon the sand, touching your feet,
						making a touch of the cool breeze of the water makes up everyone scream as they goes to the bodies of water. 
						Laugh, jump, swim and all that stuff is revolving actions of your body when your at the beach. Summer vibes is not
						only a happiness but it is also a collection of positive thoughts in everyone's mind. Conquering all the waves of suffering
						and enjoying every moment of life experiences.
